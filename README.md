### RPG --- Automated Battle System ###

Simply run game.js with node and it will select two random fighters to battle one another to the death. They may use potions and attack currently. More functionality to come!

You can change the game mode of game.js by commenting out the solo battles, and uncommenting the battle royale.

Run player_vs_npc.js to see that demo as well.
